== While The Whole World Ends 
=== KROWNS


Trying to build a life with broken parts \
Trying to hold on tight with a stitched up heart \
Caring is anarchy, filling up your head with dreams \
'Til it all goes dark \

#newVerse
So, baby, let's face it \
You know that we could be the last generation \ 
Ain't complicated, drink in our hands, 22 grams \
We can get high while the whole world ends

#newVerse
Take a ride on my spaceship \
We can take it on a permanent vacation \
No destination, drink in our hands, 22 grams \
We can get high while the whole world

#newVerse
High while the whole world ends, ``
Ends, Ends \
We can get high while the whole world ends \
Ends, Ends \
We can get high while the whole world \
High while the whole world ends 

#newVerse
Climbing these towers to the clouds \ 
Levitate while they tear this whole place down \
Diamonds in ecstasy, ripples in our gravity \
'Til it all burns out 

#newVerse
So, baby, let's face it \
You know that we could be the last generation \
Ain't complicated, drink in our hands, 22 grams \
We can get high while the whole world ends

#newVerse
Take a ride on my spaceship \
We can take it on a permanent vacation \
No destination, drink in our hands, 22 grams \
We can get high while the whole world

#newVerse
High while the whole world ends \
Ends, ends \
We can get high while the whole world ends \
Ends, ends \
We can get high while the whole world \
High while the whole world ends \

#newVerse
Feel like you're choking \
The life that you ripped open \
Every wayâ€™s the wrong way going \
Going nowhere, bruised and broken \
Don't wanna be here when I wake up

#newVerse
I wanna be in outer space \
Up like the comets, they blaze up \
Through the atmosphere they break up \
Some of the hurt, we can't foresee \
Some of the hurt that never bleeds \
Our schemes, and machines \
And our dreams that we never see

#newVerse
Now we're standing on the brink \
It's getting harder not to think \
We messed this up, and now we're sinking \
And it's all gone in a blink

#newVerse
So, baby, let's face it \
You know that we could be the last generation \
Ain't complicated, drink in our hands, 22 grams \
We can get high while the whole world ends \
Take a ride on my spaceship

#newVerse
We can take it on a permanent vacation \
No destination, drink in our hands, 22 grams \
We can get high while the whole world

#newVerse
High while the whole world ends \
There ain't nothing in the world I want more than this \
Now we're flying like kites through a black abyss \
There ain't nothing in the world that I'm gonna miss

#newVerse
We can get high while the whole world ends \
There ain't nothing in the world I want more than this \
Now we're flying like kites through a black abyss \
There ain't nothin' in the world that I'm gonna miss \
More than this, more than this
