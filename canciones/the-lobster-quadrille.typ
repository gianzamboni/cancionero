#cancion("The Lobster Quadrille","Franz Ferdinand")[
  Will you walk a little faster?
  Said a whiting to a snail
  "There's a porpoise close behind us
  Treading on my tail.
  
  See how eagerly the lobsters
  And the turtles all advance
  They are waiting on the shingle
  Will you come and join the dance? 

  Will you, won't you, won't you,
  will you, won't you join the dance?
  Will you, won't you, will you,
  Won't you, won't you join the dance?

  You can really have no notion
  How delightful it will be
  When they take us up and throw us
  With the lobsters, out to sea!"
  But the snail replied "Too far, too far!"
  And gave a look askance
  Said he thanked the whiting kindly
  But he would not join the dance.

  Would not, could not, would not,
  Could not, would not join the dance.
  Would not, could not, would not,
  Could not, could not join the dance.

  What matters it how far we go?
  His scaly friend replied
  There is another shore, you know
  Upon the other side
  The further off from England
  The nearer is to France
  Then turn not pale, beloved snail
  but come and join the dance.


  Will you, won't you, will you,
  Won't you, will you join the dance?
  Will you, won't you, will you,
  Won't you, won't you join the dance?"
