#columns(2)[
Come in, sit down sweet angel \
Leave me all your tears \
Tell me all of your troubles  \
The weight of your short years \

#newVerse
Love is only a river \
Drowning all of your cheer \
Sell me all of your laughter \
And I will take some of your fear \

#newVerse
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh \
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

His favorite days were the mornings \
She came with confessions \
of cardinal sin \
A beast in the business \
Of selling forgiveness \
Dead eyes on a treacherous grin

#newVerse
Yet he laps up the vice \
Like a wolf in the night \
He's the left hand of God on the stage \
And with one hand he offers \
Salvation to lovers \
The other, it taketh away \

#newVerse
So give me your fire \
Give me your fear \
Give me your faith  \
When love gives you tears \

#newVerse
Give me your heart \
Give me your fate \ 
Give me your hand \
When love gives you hate \

#newVerse
Give me your prayers \
Up on your feet \
And I'll give you a show \
It helps fill the seats

#newVerse
So give me your sins \
Give me your lies \
But whisper your love \
And I'll whisper mine \

#newVerse
His favorite line was \
the one formed outside \
When they trade in  \
confessions for lies \

#newVerse
A beast in the business \
Of selling forgiveness \
And buying salvation with wine \
And he cries out to God \
"How can you claim them all \
When I know that they are all mine?" \

#newVerse
So give me your fire \
Give me your fear \
Give me your faith  \
When love gives you tears \

#newVerse
Give me your heart \
Give me your fate \ 
Give me your hand \
When love gives you hate \

#newVerse
Give me your prayers \
Up on your feet \
And I'll give you a show \
It helps fill the seats

#newVerse
So give me your sins \
Give me your lies \
But whisper your love \
And I'll whisper mine \

#newVerse
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh \

#newVerse
Give me your fire \
Give me your fear \
Give me your faith  \
When love gives you tears \

#newVerse
Give me your heart \
Give me your fate \ 
Give me your hand \
When love gives you hate \

Give me your prayers \
Up on your feet \
And I'll give you a show \
It helps fill the seats

Give me your sins \
Give me your lies \
But whisper your love \
Whoa, oh-oh \

And I will take some of your fear \

Give me your fear \
Give me your faith \
When love gives you tears
