== Evil Like Me
=== Dove Cameron & Kristin Chenoweth


Look at you, look at me,  \
I don’t know who to be, mother \
Is it wrong? Is it right?  \
Be a thief in the night?, mother \
Tell me what to do

#newVerse
I was once like you, my child, slightly insecure \
Argued with my mother too, thought I was mature \
But I put my heart aside and I used my head \
Now I think it's time you learned \
What dear old mamma said

#newVerse
Don’t you wanna be evil like me?  \
Don’t you wanna be mean? \
Don't you wanna make mischief your daily routine?

#newVerse
Well you can spend your life attending to the poor \
But when you're evil doing less is doing more

#newVerse
Don't you wanna be ruthless and rotten and mad? \
Don't you wanna be very, very good at being bad? \
I have tried my whole life long \
To do the worst I can

#newVerse
Clawed my way to victory \
Built my master plan \
Now the time has come, my dear \
For you to take your place \
Promise me you’ll try to be \
An absolute disgrace

#newVerse
Don't you wanna be evil like me? \
Don't you wanna be cruel? \
Don't you wanna be nasty and brutal and cool? \

#newVerse
And when you grab that wand that's when your reign begins \
Who wants an evil queen without a sack of sins? \
Don't you wanna be heartless and hardened as stone? \
Don't you wanna be finger licking' evil to the bone?

#newVerse
This is not for us to ponder \
This was preordained \
You and I shall rule together \
Freedom soon regain \
Mistress of the universe, powerful and strong

#newVerse
Daughter, hear me \
Help me, join me \
Won't you sing along?

#newVerse
Now we're gonna be evil! \
It's true! \
Never gonna think twice \
And we're gonna be spiteful \
Yes, spiteful!

#newVerse
That's nice  \
In just an hour or two \
Our future's safe and sure \
This mother-daughter act is going out on tour
