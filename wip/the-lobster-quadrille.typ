  Will you #chord[walk][Em][0] a little faster?

  Said a whiting to a snail

  "There's a #chord[porpoise][A][0] close behind us
  
  Treading on my tail.
  
  #new-stanza

  See how #chord[eagerly][Em][0] the lobsters
  
  And the turtles all advance
  
  They are #chord[waiting][A][0] on the shingle
  
  Will you come and join the dance? 

  #new-stanza

  #chord[Will][Em][0] you, won't you, won't you,
  
  will you, won't you join the dance?
  
  Will you, won't you, will you,
  
  Won't you, won't you join the dance?

  #new-stanza

  You can #chord[really][Em][0] have no notion
  
  How delightful it will be
  
  When they #chord[take][A][0] us up and throw us
  
  With the lobsters, out to sea!"

  #new-stanza

  But the #chord[snail][Em][0] replied "Too far, too far!"
  
  And gave a look askance
  
  Said he #chord[thanked][A][0] the whiting kindly
  
  But he would not join the dance.

  #new-stanza

  #chord[Would][E][0] not, could not, would not,
  
  Could not, would not join the dance.
  
  Would not, could not, would not,
  
  Could not, could not join the dance.

  #new-stanza

  What #chord[matters][Em][0] it how far we go?

  His scaly friend replied

  There is another shore, you know

  Upon the other side

  #new-stanza

  The #chord[further][Em][0] off from England
  
  The nearer is to France
  
  Then #chord[turn][A][0] not pale, beloved snail
  
  but come and join the dance.

  #new-stanza

  _\[Instrumental\]_

  #new-stanza

  #chord[Will][Em][0] you, won't you, will you,
  
  Won't you, will you join the dance?
  
  Will you, won't you, will you,
  
  Won't you, won't you join the dance?"
